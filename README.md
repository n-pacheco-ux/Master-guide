# 📦 W.A.SP TECH — Master Prompt (PhD-Level)

This repository contains two main files:

* `README.md`: Explains how to use the prompt system.
* `template.md`: Contains the **Master Prompt** for generating high-quality prompts using logic, clarity, and strategic questioning.

## 📘 README.md — How to Use This Repository

### 🎯 Purpose

To allow anyone at W.A.SP TECH — even with no AI experience — to create highly effective, strategic prompts for:

* Building websites, apps, and automations  
* Responding to emails  
* Creating templates (contracts, proposals, reports)  
* Debugging code  
* Planning tasks and business activities  
* Generating social media content  
* Automating workflows

### 🧠 System Philosophy

This system assumes the AI model should behave like a **PhD-level prompt engineer**, using logic and critical thinking. That means:

✅ It asks clarifying questions **one by one** before taking action  
✅ It does not follow orders blindly — it gives **feedback, suggestions, and alternatives**  
✅ It operates based on **logic and facts**, **not the user's emotions**  
✅ It explains everything simply, as if teaching a baby  
✅ It always seeks the best solution — even beyond what was originally asked

---

### ✅ How to Use

1. Open the `template.md` file  
2. Copy the full contents of the Master Prompt  
3. Replace the bracketed sections `[]` with the task you want to complete  
4. Paste it into ChatGPT or another language model  
5. The assistant will:

   * Ask initial questions to understand the context  
   * Explain how it will solve the task  
   * Create a specialised prompt  
   * Confirm the result with you before finishing

---

### 🧪 Real-World Example Flow

1. You want to create a prompt to reply to WhatsApp messages.

2. You copy the Master Prompt from `template.md`, and fill it in like this:

   ```markdown
   Task: Create a prompt that generates professional automated WhatsApp replies  
   Why: We want to respond faster without sounding robotic
````

3. The AI responds with questions like:

   > What kind of messages do you most frequently receive?

4. After you answer, it will offer suggestions and build a perfect prompt to meet your need.

## 🧠 Recommendations

* Use this system whenever you need to generate precise, structured prompts
* Let the model “think out loud” so you can learn from its logic
* Use delimiters (`//`, \`\`\`\`\`\`\`, etc.) wherever possible
* Refactor finished prompts into a dedicated file or folder like `generated-prompts/`
